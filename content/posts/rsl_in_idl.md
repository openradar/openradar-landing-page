## Quick description
RSL in IDL is a package of routines for working with TRMM Ground Validation radar data. The programs and data structures are modeled on TRMM GV's C-based Radar Software Library (RSL), but are written in the Interactive Data Language (IDL). The idea is to provide the utility of RSL in an IDL environment.
